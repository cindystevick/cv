    Grief comes in many forms - it is felt in many ways and managed in many ways. Your mind does what it needs to inorder to function.
    Despite the trauma it has suffered. In order for us to heal and continue on you have to allow yourself to go through the healing process - whatever that may
    be for you.

    For me?

  <p>
    Accept -> Mourn -> Move On
  </p>
  <p>
    I had to accept the reality that the man I knew was gone forever.
    Once I was able to accept this - I was able to mourn. I couldn't mourn someone I didn't believe was gone.
    Once I fully mourned the loss of the man I loved. I was able to move on.

    Now don't confuse "moving on" with forgetting, or no longer missing, or no longer hurting.
    This is very much a misunderstood term.
    You never forget. You always miss. And you will forever hurt.
    You just learn how to take these memories, thoughts and feelings and organize them as neatly as you can into a beautiful box made - with love - by your mind.
    This box is not thrown away but put away, in a place your mind doesn't need to access inorder to carry on with your daily life.
    But from time to time, when your mind comes across the smell of their cologne, or the feeling of opening your door the morning of the first frost. That feeling
    of the ice cold air hitting your cheeks and you inhale. Letting the icy air into your lungs.
    These moments are where that box lays. And from time to time, it needs to be opened. Not to cause pain, or bring up the past. But so their memory can live on.
    You dust them off. And take a moment to remember them, how they made you feel and the impact they had on your life. And once you are done, you put them back neatly.
    And continue on.
